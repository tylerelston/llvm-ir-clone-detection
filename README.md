# Clone Detection Through the Comparison of LLVM Intermediate Representation Blocks

Compare functions and detect software clones *(slowly)* at the IR level *(with lots of false positives)*

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

https://github.com/ztane/python-Levenshtein/

## Usage

Compile programs to be tested using LLVM and generate intermediate representation files (.ll)

Gather the files in a single directory

Run **Main.py**

Identifiy directory in which .ll files are located
```
C:\Users\User\Documents\ToTest
```
